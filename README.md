### Global informations ###

#### CSS loading ####

DokuWiki load it's stylesheets from `lib/exe/css.php` which handles caching, pattern replacement, LESS preprocessing and optimizing. The loading is done via the `tpl_metaheaders()` function.

Complete documentation [here](//www.dokuwiki.org/devel:css).


##### Stylesheet modes #####

The mode of a stylesheet is defined in the `style.ini` file. The available modes are:

* **screen** : this is used when displaying pages in the web browser
* **print** : definitions here will be used for printing pages
* **all** : applied in all display modes


##### DokuWiki stylesheets #####

DokuWiki loads its stylesheets from 4 sources, which are loaded in this order:

* Base stylesheets located in `/lib/styles`: they define basic styling, like the appearance of error messages.
* Plugins styles
* Templates styles: given by the `style.ini` file
* User styles


##### Using IDs #####

To use CSS IDs in the template, we add two adjacents underscores `__`. Indeed the IDs automatically assigned are always valid pagenames so cannot contain this pattern. This ensure that there will be no conflicts in the ID's set manually and the ones generated automatically by Dokuwiki.


##### Using images and importing styles #####

Relative links to images (`url(...)`) and imported stylesheets (`@import`) are automatically fixed by DokuWiki's CSS dispatcher by treating them relative to the template's root directory.

So to include the image `img1.png` which is in the folder `images`, use the path `images/img1.png`.


#### Javascript loading ####

All JavaScript is collected and delivered by `lib/exe/js.php`. This file will concatenate all found files, whitespace compress (if compress is enabled) and cache the result. It also instructs browsers to cache the file, so when you are developing new JavaScript, be sure to refresh your browser cache (hitting Shift-F5, Shift+CTL+R or similar) whenever your script was updated.

DokuWiki will load JavaScript from the following places:

* autogenerated JavaScript (language strings, config settings, toolbar)
* `lib/scripts/*.js`
* `lib/plugins/*/script.js`
* `lib/tpl/<currenttemplate>/script.js`
* `conf/userscript.js`

Full documentation [here](https://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:javascript).


#### About the main.php file ####

Full documentation [here](//www.dokuwiki.org/devel:templates:main.php).


#### Avoiding problems ####

Here are a few problems template developers run into and how to avoid them:

* Don't put JavaScript commands in the `<body>` tag of a page. This includes onLoad and others. Although breaking this rule doesn't affect FireFox at all, Internet Explorer (even IE 7) will have JavaScript errors due to the JavaScript required for page editing, and this can result in pages that won't display correctly, and you will find the editing bar will be missing when you need it.
* Turn off `Compact CSS and JavaScript files` while developing a template.
* Some template developers experience problems with DokuWiki cacheing CSS and JS files due to this option being on, although this has been hard to pinpoint. To be safe, turn this off temporarily.
* Use `forced refreshing` after you make changes to CSS files. You can accomplish this by pressing `Ctrl+F5` or by holding down shift-control-alt and hitting the refresh button in your browser.


#### Template style.ini ####

Full documentation [here](//www.dokuwiki.org/devel:style.ini).

The `style.ini` is a ini file in each template's directory configuring the generation of CSS styles. It has two sections: `[stylesheets]` and `[replacements]` described below.


##### [stylesheets] #####

This part defines which CSS files are loaded. Each line is defined as follow:

```bash
cssfile.css = mode
```

`cssfile.css` is your file name and mode is one of the supported output modes as described at mode. The stylesheet can also be a `.less file`.


##### [replacements] #####

DokuWiki's CSS dispatcher is able to replace placeholders in the loaded stylesheets which are configured through the `[replacements]` section in the templates `style.ini`. This is especially useful for defining a color scheme once and reuse these colors in all files. These replacements can also be used as LESS variables.


### Template information ###

Full documentation available [here](//www.dokuwiki.org/devel:template_info).


## Getting started ##

Read throughfully the `Directory structure` before starting, else you're doomed to fail.


### Updates project ###

Get the last version of the project:

```bash
git pull -u origin master
```

Update the composant used:

```bash
cd .../jeece-dokuwiki-template
sudo npm update    # updates nodes.js
bower update       # updates Bower components
```

Be sure to follow the good [Git workflow](//wiki.jeece.fr/developpeur/git).


### Grunt tasks ###

Grunt is a task manager, use it to ease your development, checking your code and deploying your code.

Build the whole project:

```bash
grunt build
```

Clean the project (remove all symlinks and output files):

```bash
grunt clean
```

Watch files:

```bash
grunt watch
```

Start working without wondering which task to perfom:

```bash
grunt start
```

Validate Javascript:

```bash
grunt test-js
```

Note: since DokuWiki already compress the Javascript and CSS, it is not needed to do so with Grunt, although it does it pretty well.
