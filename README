## CSS loading ##

DokuWiki load it's stylesheets from lib/exe/css.php which handles caching, pattern replacement, LESS preprocessing and optimizing. The loading is done via the tpl_metaheaders() function.

complete documentation: https://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:css


### Stylesheet modes ###

The mode of a stylesheet is defined in the style.ini file. The available modes are:
- screen : this is used when displaying pages in the web browser
- print  : definitions here will be used for printing pages
- all    : applied in all display modes


### DokuWiki stylesheets ###

DokuWiki loads its stylesheets from 4 sources, which are loaded in this order:
- Base stylesheets located in /lib/styles: they define basic styling, like the appearance of error messages.
- Plugins styles
- Templates styles: given by the style.ini file
- User styles


### Using IDs ###

To use CSS IDs in the template, we add two adjacents underscores '__'. Indeed the IDs automatically assigned are always valid pagenames so cannot contain this pattern. This ensure that there will be no conflicts in the ID's set manually and the ones generated automatically by Dokuwiki.


### Using images and importing styles ###

Relative links to images (url(...)) and imported stylesheets (@import) are automatically fixed by DokuWiki's CSS dispatcher by treating them relative to the template's root directory.

So to include the image 'img1.png' which is in the folder 'images', use the path 'images/img1.png'.

### Avoiding problems ###

Here are a few problems template developers run into and how to avoid them:
- Don't put JavaScript commands in the <body> tag of a page. This includes onLoad and others. Although breaking this rule doesn't affect FireFox at all, Internet Explorer (even IE 7) will have JavaScript errors due to the JavaScript required for page editing, and this can result in pages that won't display correctly, and you will find the editing bar will be missing when you need it.
- Turn off "Compact CSS and JavaScript files" while developing a template.
- Some template developers experience problems with DokuWiki cacheing CSS and JS files due to this option being on, although this has been hard to pinpoint. To be safe, turn this off temporarily.
- Use "forced refreshing" after you make changes to CSS files. You can accomplish this by pressing Ctrl+F5 or by holding down shift-control-alt and hitting the refresh button in your browser.


## Template style.ini ##

Full documentation: https://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:style.ini

The style.ini is a ini file in each template's directory configuring the generation of CSS styles. It has two sections: [stylesheets] and [replacements] described below.


### [stylesheets] ###

This part defines which CSS files are loaded. Each line is defined as follow:

cssfile.css = mode

cssfile.css is your file name and mode is one of the supported output modes as described at mode. The stylesheet can also be a .less file.


### [replacements] ###

DokuWiki's CSS dispatcher is able to replace placeholders in the loaded stylesheets which are configured through the [replacements] section in the templates style.ini. This is especially useful for defining a color scheme once and reuse these colors in all files. These replacements can also be used as LESS variables.
